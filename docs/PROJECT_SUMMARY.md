# 🤖 AI Weather-Aware Scheduling Assistant - Project Summary

## What We Built

A complete AI assistant that intelligently schedules activities and answers weather queries through Telegram, built with modern AI frameworks and APIs.

### Core Functionality
- **Smart Scheduling**: "I want to go running at 4pm Saturday" → checks weather → creates event
- **Weather Queries**: "What's the weather like tomorrow?" → detailed weather info
- **Multi-turn Conversations**: Handles follow-up questions and clarifications naturally
- **Weather Intelligence**: Makes smart decisions based on rain forecasts
- **Singapore-focused**: Defaults to Singapore weather with global location support

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Framework Stack
- **LangChain**: AI framework for building language model applications
- **LangGraph**: Workflow orchestration with conditional routing
- **Gemini 2.0**: Google's latest AI model for intent extraction
- **Telegram Bot API**: User interface and messaging
- **OpenWeatherMap**: Real-time weather data and 5-day forecasts
- **Google Calendar API**: Event management (mocked, ready for real integration)

### Key Design Patterns
- **State Management**: LangGraph manages conversation state and context
- **Conditional Routing**: Weather-based and intent-based decision making
- **Context Preservation**: Multi-turn conversation support with smart cleanup
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for API failures
- **Modular Design**: Separate clients for each API service
